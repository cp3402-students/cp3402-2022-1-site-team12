<h1>Site</h1>
<br>This website is built using WordPress upon the Underscores starter theme.
<br>Fundamentally operating the site remains the same as any default WordPress website. In the Dashboard you can create and edit pages in the Pages tab, install plugins, etc. It is primarily the plugins that change how you'd maintain, organise, and update this website. To be able to customise and shape the website to what we desired the following plugins were used:
<br>(Note: All plugins used were through their free versions, so any functionality provided by their paid versions were not used and is not required to maintain the site)
<br>•	MetaSlider: A slideshow plugin for an automatic “mini-gallery”
<br>•	Modula: A gallery-builder used in the Gallery page for the different events hosted throughout 2008 - 2022
<br>•	WPForms lite:  Used to create forms (Primarily for the membership form)
<br>•	WPGoogle Maps: For adding a Google-Maps map, such as in the Contact Us page to show the Jazz Clubs location

<h3>MetaSlider:</h3>
<br>MetaSlider can be accessed at the bottom of the dashboard. To create a slideshow, select “New” at the top right then “Add Slide” to the left of that to add the photos that will populate the slideshow. When adding a new photo, you can select a photo from the media library or just upload an image. The image title and captions wont matter, they aren’t shown in the slideshow, so you can just continue and select your image. Once all the images are added it can be saved by pressing “Save” at the very top right.
<br>A slider can be added through editing a page and adding a MetaSlider block, at which point you can choose which slideshow you want shown.
<br>The only slideshow currently on the website, Step Out Step Up, was included in the STEP OUT STEP UP post which can be found in the History of Jazz page.

<h3>Modula:</h3>
<br>To add a gallery simply select Modula in the dashboards left navigation and “Add New”. In the empty centre section, you can either drag and drop images that you want to add to the gallery or select the “Upload images files/ Select from Library” buttons to import them. From there once they are imported you can move the images around to match the order they will be shown in. Hovering over an image you can either delete it or edit it. If you edit it, options to change the image title or caption text will be the primary changes you can make. With the gallery opened you can scroll down to view the settings. In Captions you can change the colour and size of the font for the title and captions of all the images in that gallery. At the very bottom is a section for custom CSS, which is where you will find the code for the title and captions having a white background behind them.
<br>When editing a page specifically, you can add a Modula gallery as a block and it will give you the option to select which gallery you wish to display. With multiple blocks you can add as many galleries as needed.

<h3>WPForms lite:</h3>
<br>This plugin was used to make the Join Us form, where users can fill out their details and become a Jazz Club member. The plugin was not used anywhere else.
<br>To make a form simply select the plugin in the dashboard, and next to “Forms Overview” select “Add New”. Here you can name your form and choose from a wide variety of templates to use, though whichever template you use you can edit completely in the next page. In the editing page, simply drag and drop whatever field you want, be that a checkbox, email, multiple choice field, and so on. You can select any field that’s in the form and edit its label, format, description, or in the case of a multiple-choice field, you can chance the choices. Once all the fields are added and edited, you can save the form at the top right and then close the window. If you want to see what the form will look like before saving, or at any other time, simply press “Preview”, just left of where you would save it.
<br>The form can be added to any page through a block. When editing a page simply add a block, search for WPForm, then select that and choose which form you want displayed for that particular block.

<h3>WPGoogle Maps:</h3>
<br>This plugin is fairly similar to Modula, it is located in the dashboard’s navigation bar near the bottom, and when editing pages, it can be added to the page as a standard block with any pre-saved map chosen to be displayed.
<br>To create a map, select WPGoogle Maps in the dashboard, and create a new map. You will be brought to a customisation page where you will make all the changes to the map. In the “Edit Marker” section under the “Marker” tab you can write the location you want the map to be centred on and different animations for the marker to make, then press “Save Marker” to save it. You can edit an existing marker by scrolling down to “Edit existing Markers” and select the first option under “Action” to the far right. Once you have made all the changes needed, scroll back to the top and select “Save Map” to save and ready it for being added to a page.
<br>The free version of this plugins seems to only allow for one saved map at a time, so if more maps are needed it will be necessary to purchase the pro-version.

<h3>Posts:</h3>
<br>In the History of Jazz and Our Musos page it uses posts as the content. When creating a post, it will include a category which one can edit, and it will determine where the post will be displayed. For example, in the “Our Musos” page it is made up of posts that are under the “musos” category.
<br>Creating a post is done through the Posts section in the dashboard, select “Add New” once you are in the Posts section. This will take you to a page that looks like any normal page when editing it. Add a title and an image of the musician you want the post to be about. Below this you can add any text about the band/musician that is needed. You will also need to change the Category (bottom-right) to the appropriate category, be that History of Jazz or Musos. Once done select “Update” at the top right and your post is finished.
<br>Then once the post is made go back to the Musos page and add all the posts of that category to one page using a standard post block. This block will automatically sort and display all posts of a particular category. Select “Update” to finalise the page.
