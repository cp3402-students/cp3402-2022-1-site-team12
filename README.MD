Team 12 CMS Site Development
===

What’s Included
---
This is a `project by 3rd Year Bachelor of IT students` to enable them to `synthesise` and `practice` what they have learnt. The project involved `hearing from a client` who has a website that needs to be redesigned. The client’s website has been designed and created by an older gentleman and has the look and feel of something created in the eighties. The client would like to `bring his website into the modern era`, to `make it exciting` as well as `appealing` to and `creating a love of jazz to a younger group of people`. This is `our interpretation` of what a `modern Jazz Club website` should be.

This site was created using `WordPress` - a `content management system` for websites and `hosted online using HostGator`. A link to the website can be found here: https://jazzclub.website/

In the directories of the repository, you’ll find files for a `theme called Team12` and `documentation files` for the project. This theme was created from a starter theme called Underscores.
